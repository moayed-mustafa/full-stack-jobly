-- tasks:-


### Authentication.


### make components for the forms, maybe put them on their own directory
### make the search bar on caompanies and jobs
### figure out the apply button re-render


## The problem with authentication:-
### I'm using the home component to check for the user session in local storage and then
### set a state that reflects a login position, the problem is that, when the page reloads, the
### state changes, which means it will be returned to false regardless of user session being available or
### not
